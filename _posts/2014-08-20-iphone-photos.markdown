Growing families, i.e. babies, obviously require TONS of photos. Falling close behind, of course, are selfies, things we're about to eat, and place I am & you're not.

I field a fair amount of phone calls from friends and family members about technological issues. One question that I've seem to get over & over:

>"I've run out of space on my iPhone, how do I back-up my photos?"

At first glance, this seems pretty simple: 

1. Plug iPhone into computer
2. Save photos from said iPhone to hard drive
3. Erase photos from iPhone
4. Unplug
5. Take more photos

>"Yes, but then I lose 24/7 access to them."

## Ok, you can have your cake and eat it too!

So, let's state the problem, just so we're all on the same page:

**Easily back-up photos on an iPhone, free up storage, but still have access to all your photos**

##iCloud

The first reaction is to use [iCloud](https://iCloud.com). While that's certainly is a great way to BACK-UP your photos. Look around for a solution and you'll quickly become confused w/ the different scenarios that will and won't work. Long story short, you'll end up losing photos sooner or later.
