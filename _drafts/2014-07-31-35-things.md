I turned 35 this year. While attending Big Omaha, I heard one of the speakers tell a story how, when he turned 35, he wrote down a list of things he’d learned in life. I thought, "I should do that!". Then I thought, "what if I can’t come up with 35 things…". 

The posts that follow are a somewhat random ordered list of experiences, quotes, and conversations that I feel have been incredible life lessons that have helped me get to the here and now, and moderately. I've done my best to attribute each lesson to a person or circumstance.
